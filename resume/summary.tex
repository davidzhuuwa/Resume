Keen interest in the development, optimisation and control of engineering
processes within the energy industry. Strong research background of over 4 years
in the Fluid Science and Resources division at UWA, with a focus on modelling in
flow assurance and thermophysics contexts. Penultimate-year PhD student looking to broaden my
horizons with an industry placement within the energy industry. 
A reliable and self-motivated individual who strives
to do their best in all situations and is keen to make their contribution to
society in the transition to renewable energy sources. Thanks to writing
peer-reviewed articles, industry reports, and delivering conference talks to an
international audience, I am able to communicate effectively with both technical
and non-technical audiences. Enjoys challenges and
works well in a team. 

%Keen interest in the development and optimisation of engineering practices in
%the oil and gas industry, namely flow assurance. Strong research background of
%over 4 years in the Fluid Science and Resources division at UWA, part of which
%was towards completion of my Honours thesis. My engineering degree has been
%primarily oil and gas-centric, with core subjects focussing on upstream
%petroleum operations, mid-stream flow assurance concept development and
%downstream simulation of the Kleenheat LNG plant. I wish to further develop my
%knowledge in this field by pursuing a PhD at UWA within the flow assurance
%context. My research will focus on thermodynamic software development that will
%form the basis of the creation of more efficient engineering processes in the
%LNG industry through greater accuracy in the prediction of hydrocarbon fluid
%physical properties.


%Keen interest in the development, optimisation and control of engineering
%processes, with a strong research background in maintenance and flow assurance.
%Penultimate year chemical and process engineering student looking to develop
%and apply technical skills and knowledge to meaningful projects while working
%alongside like-minded people in a dynamic environment in the water sector, as
%well as the opportunity to travel and work on-site. A reliable and
%self-motivated individual who strives to do their best in all situations and is
%keen to make their contribution to society. Enjoys challenges and works well in
%teams.
